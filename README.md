If there is one thing that Mister Rogers was good at, it was explaining
how things get made. For me, the visit to a [crayon
factory](https://www.misterrogers.org/episodes/a-visit-to-a-crayon-factory/)
is as good as it gets. I wanted to find all the episodes where Mister
Rogers teaches how something gets made so I did some text scraping with
[Beautiful
Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/index.html)
and compiled this list. Pull Requests definitely welcome!
